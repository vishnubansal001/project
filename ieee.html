                <h2>About IEEE</h2>
                <p class="disptag"> IEEE is the world's largest professional association, which is dedicated to taking
                    technological innovation forward.

                    The global community derives inspiration from IEEE and its members through its publications,
                    conferences, technology standards, professional and educational activities.

                    Members collaborate through a platform provided by the IEEE on world-changing technologies, from
                    computing and sustainable energy systems, to aerospace, communications, robotics, healthcare, and
                    more.

                    More and more lives have been touched by IEEE's role over the decades that have followed.

                    IEEE Societies comprises professional groups and technical boards of the predecessor institutions.
                    There were 38 societies by the early 21st Century, through which the IEEE served its members and
                    their interests; apart from 130 journals, there are transactions and magazines; more 300 conferences
                    annually and 900 active standards.

                    This was the time when the virtual world became more compact, all a part of a global network
                    connected by satellites and then by fiber optics.

                    The area of interest of IEEE was not limited to electrical/electronic engineering and computing, it
                    expanded to areas such as micro- and nanotechnology, ultrasonics, bioengineering, robotics,
                    electronic materials, and many others.

                    Electronics became omnipresent. We could not do without them. IEEE kept an account of every possible
                    innovation that was made and become a global institution, which used the innovations of the
                    practitioners it represented in order to enhance its own excellence in delivering products and
                    services to members, industries, and the public at large.

                    Publications and educational programs were delivered online, as were member services such as renewal
                    and elections. By 2010, IEEE had over 395,000 members in 160 countries.

                    Through its worldwide network of geographical units, publications, web services, and conferences,
                    IEEE remains the world's largest technical professional association.

                    It was in 2009 when IEEE student branch was established at Chitkara University's Punjab campus. When
                    the branch was launched, there were 12 student members and three faculty members. Since then, a lot
                    of interest has been expressed by student members in organizing and conducting various activities
                    under IEEE flagship. At present, there are about 28 student members with the number growing.
